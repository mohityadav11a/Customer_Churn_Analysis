# Customer_Churn_Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer churn behavior in the telecommunications industry. The primary objective is to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations that influence customer retention and identify potential risk factors associated with churn.

Using Python and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project explores various customer attributes—such as contract type, tenure, payment methods, and subscription to value-added services—to assess their impact on churn.

Key findings reveal that customers with month-to-month contracts, short tenure, and those using electronic checks as a payment method are significantly more likely to churn. In contrast, customers subscribed to services like Phone Service, Online Security, Tech Support, and DSL Internet are more likely to stay.

This analysis offers valuable business insights for telecom providers to enhance customer retention strategies and informs the development of predictive churn models in future phases.
